## Operating philosophy

- Relentlessly focused on weekly progress
- **The Elon method boiled all the way down is "what have you gotten done this week?"**
- Rejects traditional corporate timelines and long-term planning over months and years

## Engineering-first approach

- Works predominantly with engineers
- Personally understands all technical systems
- Avoids non-engineering meetings/conversations when possible, joins all the core engineering focused meetings
- Skips management layers completely
- **Talks directly to person in charge of specific project**
- He's in there with 24-year-old engineers and they'll just walk through fire for him
- Engineers deeply respect his technical knowledge

## Weekly problem-solving method

- **Identifies key bottleneck at each company weekly**
- Works directly with engineers to fix it that same week
- Maintains this pace across multiple companies simultaneously
- Late night work sessions are normal

## Rapid iteration

- Embraces public failure as learning opportunity
- SpaceX:
- Ran through five rocket generations of which four would fail but he would learn so much that the fifth one would work
- Would go through the five generations faster than his rocket competitors could do one generation
- **Doesn't let public perception slow progress**
- Willing to have rockets explode in testing

## First principles thinking

- Gets to fundamental reality quickly
- Eliminates unnecessary processes
- Focuses purely on substance
- Rejects traditional corporate structure
- **No Powerpoint presentations**
- Minimal documentation
